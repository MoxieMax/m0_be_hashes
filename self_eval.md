# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  - I had some trouble with printing hashes that didn't have a required puts statement (ex: puts "[key] does something with [value]"). I think something about having it as a sentence helps my brain make sense of it, but I don't think it's always going to be part of the code.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  - I try to take notes on definitions and specific examples, using colors to differentiate between different things like the term, the definition, the examples, etc...
  - As with most things, I apparently do my best work during the hours in which I am supposed to sleep, but outside of that I take better notes on the first half of the instructional pages, less so as I go down through it and work through examples since those tend to end up in a practice file instead of written out by hand.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  - First I look through the instructional Mod 0 page for an example, if I can't find that I check my notes, then google, and if I can't get the result I'm looking for I tend to ask my wife if she's got any ideas. She doesn't give me answers, but does a lot to help me work through the problem step by step. I've yet to run into something that I can't solve with one of those.
